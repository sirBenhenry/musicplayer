/**
 * OPT #6 — Cached instances of frequently-used AbsoluteSmoothCornerShape.
 *
 * AbsoluteSmoothCornerShape is significantly more expensive than RoundedCornerShape because it
 * computes cubic Bézier curves analytically. In LazyColumn items (song cards, album cards, etc.)
 * each item pays this cost on first composition. By reusing singleton instances we avoid
 * repeated Path construction for the most common radii.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   Modifier.clip(ShapeCache.smooth12)
 *   Modifier.background(color, ShapeCache.smooth16)
